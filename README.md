A collection of virtual machines for dealing with all sorts of
network configuration systems. I want to be able to configure
and upgrade routers as single things as well as whole systems.

You need vagrant, ansible and virtualbox in order to run this
self-sustaining on your laptop. On a Mac, they're installed
like so:

  brew install Caskroom/cask/vagrant
  brew install Caskroom/cask/virtualbox
  brew install ansible
